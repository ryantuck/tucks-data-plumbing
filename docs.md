# Docs

Various thoughts on documentation.

## GitHub repo as docs store?

Repo too much overhead for docs maintenance? Past what point? How is this meaningfully different from code, which is also a set of text files that is interpreted and potentially acted upon? Both are blessed text strings, though with differing guarantees.
